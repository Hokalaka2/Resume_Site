							<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
							<p> I spent my childhood in Stockholm, Sweden, where I developed a passion for soccer, learning, and experimenting with technology. In middle school, my family moved to Louisville, Kentucky where I continued to play soccer and was fortunate to attend a STEM magnet school, graduating from DuPont Manual High School in 2019. Before College, I decided to return to Sweden for a gap year where I worked and explored Europe. Iâ€™m now at Middlebury College in Vermont where I am majoring in Computer Science. At Middlebury, I am able to combine an outdoor lifestyle with the diverse and engaging academic opportunities offered by the college and professors. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy challenging myself by learning new computer programs and technologies and applying those to personal projects and classwork. 
							</br></br>On a normal day, you can find me on a hike, mountain bike riding, hanging out with friends, or playing board games such as Catan or Chess. I love spending time outdoors and enjoy almost any activity that involves fresh air. </p>
